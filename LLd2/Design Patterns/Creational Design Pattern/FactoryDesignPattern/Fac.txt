Abstract Factory Notes
-------------------------
Factory Design Pattern
The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. 
It provides an interface or abstract class for creating objects, but the specific type of objects is determined by the concrete subclasses. 
This pattern is useful for decoupling the client code from the details of object creation.

Factory Method
The Factory Method is a specific implementation of the Factory Design Pattern. 
It defines an interface (or an abstract class) with a method for creating objects, 
but it allows subclasses to implement this method to produce objects of different types


Abstract Factory
------------------
The Abstract Factory is another variation of the Factory Design Pattern that provides an interface for creating 
families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's used when you need to ensure 
that the created objects are compatible with each other.


Difference Between Abstract Factory and Abstract Method
-------------------------------------------------------- 
The Abstract Factory and Factory Method patterns are both creational design patterns, but they serve different purposes 
and have distinct characteristics. Here are the key differences between the Abstract Factory and Factory Method patterns:

Intent:

Abstract Factory: The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects 
without specifying their concrete classes. It is focused on creating multiple related products (objects) that work together. 
The emphasis is on creating a family of products.

Factory Method: The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the 
type of objects that will be created. It is focused on creating a single product (object) type with multiple variants. 
The emphasis is on creating a single product.

Scope:

Abstract Factory: It deals with creating multiple related products that are designed to work together, forming a product family.

Factory Method: It typically deals with the creation of a single product or a family of related products (but typically just one)
