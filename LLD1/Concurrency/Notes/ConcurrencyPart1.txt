In Java, concurrency is a fundamental concept that allows you to execute multiple tasks or processes concurrently, 
making better use of available system resources and potentially improving the performance of your applications. 
Concurrency in Java is typically achieved through the use of processes and threads. 
Let's introduce these concepts in more detail:

1. **Processes**:
   - In the context of Java, a process refers to a self-contained execution environment that includes its own memory space, resources, 
and a single Java Virtual Machine (JVM) instance. Each Java application typically runs in its own process.
   - Processes are heavyweight and relatively expensive in terms of system resources. They are isolated from each other, 
and communication between processes often involves inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like sockets, pipes, or message queues.

All data of an executing process is stored at RAM.

2. **Threads**:
   - Threads are lightweight subunits of a process that share the same memory space and resources as the parent process. They are also known as "lightweight processes."
   - Java provides built-in support for creating and managing threads through the `java.lang.Thread` class.
   - Threads allow you to perform multiple tasks simultaneously within a single process, and they are more efficient in terms of resource usage compared to processes.
   - Threads in Java are often used to achieve concurrency within an application. For example, you can use threads to handle multiple clients in a server application 
or to improve the responsiveness of a graphical user interface (GUI) application.

Here's a simple example of creating and running a thread in Java:

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed in the thread
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread: " + i);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread

        // Code executed by the main thread
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println("Main: " + i);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a custom thread class `MyThread` that extends `Thread` and overrides the `run` method. 
We start this thread using `start()`, and it runs concurrently with the main thread, producing interleaved output.

Keep in mind that while threads provide concurrency, they also introduce challenges like thread synchronization,
 which is essential for avoiding issues like race conditions when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently. 
Java provides tools and mechanisms such as `synchronized` blocks, locks, and the `java.util.concurrent` package to help manage thread synchronization and coordination.


Concurrency and parallelism
=============================

Concurrency and parallelism are two related but distinct concepts in the context of computer programming and multi-tasking. They both involve executing multiple 
tasks or processes, but they differ in how these tasks are managed and executed.

**Concurrency**:

1. **Definition**: Concurrency is a concept where multiple tasks are executed in overlapping time intervals, allowing the illusion of simultaneous execution. 
It doesn't necessarily mean that tasks are running simultaneously on multiple processors or cores.

2. **Execution Model**: In a concurrent system, tasks are typically managed by a scheduler that switches between them rapidly, giving the appearance of parallelism. 
These tasks can be processes or threads within a single process.

3. **Use Cases**: Concurrency is commonly used to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of applications, especially when tasks may block or wait for 
external resources (e.g., I/O operations). It allows an application to continue executing other tasks while waiting for slow operations to complete.

4. **Example**: A web server handling multiple client requests concurrently. While one client's request is waiting for a database query to complete, 
the server can process other incoming requests.

**Parallelism**:

1. **Definition**: Parallelism is the actual simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes on multiple processors or CPU cores, 
with the goal of improving performance and achieving true parallel processing.

2. **Execution Model**: Parallelism requires multiple physical or logical processing units, such as multiple CPU cores. 
Each task is assigned to a separate processing unit and executes independently.

3. **Use Cases**: Parallelism is used when you have computationally intensive tasks that can be divided into smaller 
subtasks that can be executed in parallel. It is often used to take advantage of modern multi-core processors for speeding up calculations.

4. **Example**: Image processing software that applies filters to different parts of an image simultaneously by 
utilizing multiple CPU cores for parallel processing.

In summary, concurrency is about managing and organizing tasks to make efficient use of available resources, 
allowing tasks to overlap in execution. Parallelism, on the other hand, is about executing tasks simultaneously on 
multiple processing units to achieve actual parallel execution and improve performance.

It's worth noting that some programming languages and frameworks provide mechanisms for both concurrency and parallelism. 
Java, for example, supports both through threads (concurrency) and the Java Fork-Join framework (parallelism), 
which allows developers to write code that takes advantage of multi-core processors.
