In Java, the `final` keyword can be used in various contexts to indicate that something is unchangeable or has a specific behavior. Here are some common uses of the `final` keyword in Java:

1. **Final Variables**: When you declare a variable as `final`, its value cannot be changed once it has been assigned. This is often used for constants.

   ```java
   final int x = 10;
   // x = 20; // This will result in a compilation error
   ```

2. **Final Methods**: When you declare a method as `final` in a class, it means that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses.

   ```java
   class Parent {
       final void show() {
           System.out.println("This is a final method.");
       }
   }

   class Child extends Parent {
       // Cannot override the final method 'show'
       // void show() { } // This will result in a compilation error
   }
   ```

3. **Final Classes**: When you declare a class as `final`, it means that no other class can inherit from it. You cannot create subclasses of a `final` class.

   ```java
   final class MyFinalClass {
       // Class members and methods here
   }

   // Cannot create a subclass of MyFinalClass
   // class Subclass extends MyFinalClass { } // This will result in a compilation error
   ```

4. **Final Parameters**: When you declare a parameter as `final` in a method, it means that the parameter cannot be reassigned within the method.

   ```java
   void processData(final int value) {
       // value = 20; // This will result in a compilation error
       System.out.println("Value: " + value);
   }
   ```

5. **Final Fields in Objects**: When you declare an instance variable as `final` in a class, it means that each object of the class can have a different value for that field, but once set, it cannot be changed.

   ```java
   class MyClass {
       final int myField;

       MyClass(int value) {
           myField = value;
       }
   }
   ```

Using `final` appropriately can help improve code readability, maintainability, and prevent unintended changes or extensions of classes and methods.
